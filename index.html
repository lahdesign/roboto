                <p class="history-paragraph" >
                  Roboto is a modern sans-serif typeface that was developed by Google as the system font for its Android operating system. Designed by Christian Robertson, Roboto was introduced with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) in 2011 and has since become widely used in various digital platforms and applications.
                  One of Roboto's key design principles is its versatility. It features a clean and neutral appearance, making it suitable for a wide range of contexts, from user interfaces to printed materials. Its geometric shapes and open letterforms enhance readability on screens of all sizes, contributing to a comfortable reading experience for users.                </p>

            <h1 class="early-development"> Early Development</h1>
                <p class="early-development-paragraph" >The new typeface, Roboto, was designed entirely in-house by Christian Robertson who previously had released an expanded Ubuntu Titling font through his personal type foundry Betatype. The font was officially made available for free download on January 12, 2012, on the newly launched Android Design website.</p>
                <p class="early-development-paragraph-2"> Compared to the humanist sans-serif Droid Sans, Roboto belongs to the neo-grotesque genre of sans-serif typefaces. It includes Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold and Black weights with matching oblique styles rather than true italics. It also includes condensed styles in Light, Regular and Bold, also with matching oblique designs.</p>
