# type-single-page
My font choice for this project was Roboto. It was used as a variable type for this project called Roboto Flex. A few specific things I learned through completign this project was how to put in grids, using buttons and attaching links, and a better understanding on how to read HTML / CSS.
I had alot of trouble digesting code and how certain things affected the overall page but through this project I feel like I have a better understanding than I did with the last project. I did not use any chat GPT my code only sampled things Laura sent in the discord like starter code and things we worked on in her office hours.
